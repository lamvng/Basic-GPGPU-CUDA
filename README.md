# Basic-GPGPU-CUDA

This is a step-by-step guide for beginners towards GPGPU structure and CUDA programming. Along with my own explanation, I also references some great documents and tutorials so you can discover yourself.

Some concepts are mentioned and explained in this tutorial, including:

* Basic CUDA structure;
* Thread indexing;
* Thread hierarchy;
* Shared memory and conflict management;
* Block reduction;

### Prerequisites

> Basic understanding of C/C++ is enough to start the tutorial.

### Personal notes

>>
This tutorial is in fact my personal notes from the course "Programming with GPGPU" by Dr. Pierre-Fran√ßois Bonnefoi. The course (in French only) is available [here](https://p-fb.net/master-1/gpgpu.html). On a personal side, I admired his effort and passion to deliver huge course contents and detailed instruction.
